The North Asia propane/MOPJ \nnaphtha derivative spreads would be calculated from the \ncorresponding Platts assessments at their respective close.\nVOLUME: The new propane outright assessments and \nderivative spreads would reflect a tradeable clip size of 5,000 mt.\nThe proposed North Asia propane derivatives assessments \nwould be based on bids, offers, or trades seen during the Platts \nMarket on the Close assessment process.
